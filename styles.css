    Seems like you're trying to center this content with position absolute and px values. 
    This works on certain viewport sizes but it won't always be in the middle. For example, on a phone that's 480px wide, 
    the content will be offscreen. 
    This would be a good spot to use flexbox. You can set the container to be positioned absolute and span across the whole
    page (100vh height and 100vw width), and then have an html element inside of it that's centered vertically and horizontally!
